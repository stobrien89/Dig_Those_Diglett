## Game Summary

The game is essentially and arcade-style version of Whack-A-Mole, with a Two-Player Mode and three difficulty levels.  The idea came to me after having spent a lot of time indoors during lockdown playing older video games.

The game itself consists of one round that can be replayed ad-infinitumâ€”- In one-player, the player must register at least 8 hits to trigger a win.  In two-player, players take turns on the board and the player with the higest score in the end wins.

## Wireframe

My wireframing went a little something like this:

Below is what I started with:

...aaand I sort of made it up as I went after that.

## Challenges/Future Goals/Lessons Learned:

Future goals: 
-Update game logic to include different levels/board layouts
-Re-do board design to better align board elements and indexing
-Fix background images and animations for a true infinite scroll
-More responsive design
-add typewriter(no cursor) effect to diaglogue boxes

Challenges:
-Positioning grid children (Will probably use flex for the board on 2nd run)
-So focused on concept, at one point I forgot what the game requirements were and had to add win and loss modes
-fixing bugs without much pseudocode to reference

Lessons learned:
-Definitely need to plan stages of development/execution
-spend way more time pseudocoding
-Need to focus on one thing at a time (would notice something I liked or didn't like and dropped what I was doing to work on it)
