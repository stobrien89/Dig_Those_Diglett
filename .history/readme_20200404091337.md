##Game Summary

The game is essentially and arcade-style version of Whack-A-Mole, with a Two-Player Mode and three difficulty levels.  The idea came to me after having spent a lot of time indoors during lockdown playing older video games.

The game itself consists of one round that can be replayed ad-infinitumâ€”- In one-player, the player must register at least 8 hits to trigger a win.  In two-player, players take turns on the board and the player with the higest score in the end wins.
